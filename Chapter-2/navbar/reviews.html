        <p> ★★★★★-Star Rating by: Mike young <br> This game was the bestest gift from heaven. very awesome gameplay, a cast of cute pokemon, and is classified as a complete masterpiece from the first three entries in the series. It even has a debug mode in which you can enter via a special in-game cheat code or a cheating device (do not cheat in any of the games, or else the cheating device will create an imbalance and the end of the pokemon world as we know it). I discovered that, with the special debug mode code, you can make any pokemon learn any mode (i did that with the platinum's normal type cute bunny pokemon who knows belly drum, outrage, iron head, and recover). For example, this region's normal type bunny defeated everyone with this moveset (it knows huge power, too). I highly worship this game as if it were a popular music artist like Katy Perry: no other Pokemon game comes close to this powerhouse of this game. I recommend this highly treasured and flawless masterpiece to every fan of the series</p>
        <p> ★★★★★-Star Rating by: Nicholas Cecic <br> Pokémon Platinum, is in my opinion, the best Pokémon game to date (beating Heart Gold and Soul Silver by just a bit). Pokémon Platinum is the third version to Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, and just blows those games out of the water! This game has faster speed, an upgraded Pokédex (more than just two fully evolved fire types in the main story), better story and the Distortion World, where Giratina lurks and the rules of physics don't apply! This game is also good as it is just the right amount of challenge and fun. I played through the game with an Empoleon, an Espeon, a Houndoom, a Porygon-Z, a Crobat and a Giratina (replaced by a Primeape in the post-game). The post game is also fun with a new island to explore, the Stark Mountain side-quest, facing the old gym leaders and allies in the Battleground and the entire Battle Frontier. A great game for the Nintendo DS! 10/10.</p>
        <p> ★★★★★-Star Rating by: Aztum The Knight Of Wumbo <br> I have played this game as a kid growing up. The first Pokemon game I ever beat, and the first I ever played. Platinum more than makes up for the catastrophe that was the first two Sinnoh games. It even holds up better than the DP remakes apparently. In light of the remakes, allow me to offer you my reasons for why Platinum is so good: 
            <ol>
                <li> Improved story that involves Giratina, the master of the Distortion World.</li>
                <li> Improved Graphics environments from the first two games.</li>
                <li> More Pokemon to catch in total to complete the Pokedex. From 150 - 210.</li>
                <li> More Fire Type Pokemon to choose from, no longer limiting you to the use of Chimchar and Ponyta.</li>
                <li> Access to certain areas sooner than usual.</li>
                <li> Way better Post-game that allows the player more content and even an improved Heatran quest.</li>
            </ol>
            All in all, this game I would 100% recommend to anyone who loves Pokemon. It's fun, fairly challenging, the difficulty curve is manageable, and the overall gameplay is phenomenal. 10/10.
